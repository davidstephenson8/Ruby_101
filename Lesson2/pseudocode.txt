Write pseudocode for the following:

a method that returns the sum of two integers

Start
Get two integers from the user
Sum the two integers
Set the result of the sum equal to a variable
Print the result to the user
End

a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Take the first value in the array and store it in a variable
Concatenate the second value in the array to the first and store the new string
Take the third value in the array and add it to the string formed from the first and second values
Continue through the entire array
Once the program has added each value to the string, return the variable with all concatenated strings


a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. 

Start
Read first element from array
Pass it into a new array
Skip next element
Read third element from array
Pass it into the array created above
Continue this process until the end of the array

a method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return nil.

Start
Read first letter of string
Pass letter into an array, increment second value in the array by one
Read second letter for string
If equal to letter in first array, increment second value in the array by one
Else create a new array and increment second value in the array by one
Read third letter of string
If equal to letter in first or second arrays, increment second value in the array by one
Check to see if any of the second values in our arrays are equal to 3. 
If any of the values are equal to 3, return the first value of the array
Else continue looping through string
Continue until some 2nd array value is equal to 3. 
End

a method that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes. 

Start
Read the first value of the first array. 
Add it to a new array
Read the first value of the second array
Add it to the new array
Read the second value of the first array
Add it to the new array
Read the second value of the second array
Add it to the new array
Continue until you've added all values from both arrays
End
